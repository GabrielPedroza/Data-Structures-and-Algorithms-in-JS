			This is a repo that talks about Data Structure and Algorithms in
			depth (using the context of coding interviews). Since I am a frontend
			engineer, I aimed the DSA towards that since frontend engineers go
			through more nuanced interviews than regular software engineers

			Things to know before going into the JavaScript files:

			Basic and somewhat intermediate Javascript knowledge
			Understand Big O Notation in respect to time and space from best to worst case:

			- O(1) is also known as constant 
			- O(N) is also known as linear 
			- O(Log(N)) is also known as Logarithmic(ally) 
			- O(NLog(N)) is also known as Log-Linear 
			- O(N^2) is also known as quadratic
			- O(N^3) is also known as cubic
			- O(2^N) is also known as exponential
			- O(n!) is also known as factorial

			You can use the live server extension from VS code to launch the files and write out some test cases
