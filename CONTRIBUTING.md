The main purpose of this repo is to help programmers grok Data Structures and Algorithms so they can not only strengthen
their current problem-solving skills but pass coding interviews that they may face using JavaScript. I am not too picky on 
how I want you to contribute but whatever you want to add/alter/delete has to make sense. Make sure your commit/issue message
makes sense and has correlation on what you want to alter and be somewhat descriptive so we don't have to go back and forth.
Once all the major data structures are added, we can CI/CD into another folder with some interview questions like Blind75 and 
integrate Jest for TDD
